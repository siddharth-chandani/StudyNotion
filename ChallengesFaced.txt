1. Forgot to add user in localstorage 
I was logged in and along with I was developing the page of dashboard 
and then when i try to see this then it in the frontend then it was showing un-defined
Why? Bcz i havent store the value of user in localstorage and the page was already refreshed
And I was unaware about that, So I took a learing there


2. In the Add Section button, I mistakely set the onclick buttton syntax wrongly.
Instead of calling the function in the arrow function, I directly called the function name in the onclick event.
